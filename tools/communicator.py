"""Communicator agent for the Rootâ€‘MAS platform.

The Communicator agent is responsible for interfacing with the user via
Telegram.  It listens for incoming text and voice messages, converts voice
messages to text using Yandex SpeechKit (via the `SpeechKitClient` defined in
`tools/telegram_voice.py`) and forwards user input into the MAS.  It also
handles outgoing messages by converting assistant responses into speech and
sending them back to Telegram.

This implementation is a skeleton.  The actual network interactions with
Telegram and Yandex services are left as placeholders.
