# Defines lists of language models ordered by price.  When invoking a tool
# function that requires an LLM, the system will select the cheapest model
# available for the current tier and attempt to use it.  If the result is
# unsatisfactory or an error occurs, the callback can request a higher tier.

cheap:
  # Low‑cost models for routine tasks.  Adjust these identifiers based on
  # models available via your provider (e.g. OpenRouter).
